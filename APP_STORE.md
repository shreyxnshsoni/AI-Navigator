### Title
**AI Navigator - Navigate Long AI Conversations**

### Short Description
Transform long AI chats into structured, navigable timelines. Privacy-first browser extension with minimap, timestamps, sessions, and search.

### Full Description

**Navigate Your AI Conversations Like Never Before**

AI Navigator transforms long, messy AI chats into structured, navigable knowledge spaces. Perfect for students, developers, researchers, and anyone who uses AI tools for deep thinking.

**The Problem**
AI conversations are getting longer — hundreds or thousands of messages. But finding important information means endless scrolling. Important insights get lost. There's no sense of time or structure.

**The Solution**
AI Navigator adds powerful navigation tools to your AI chats:

🗺️ **Conversation Minimap**
- See your entire chat at a glance
- Jump to any part instantly
- Navigate 500+ messages in seconds

⏰ **Automatic Timestamps**
- Every message gets date and time
- Session grouping automatically
- Timeline of your thinking

📅 **Session Detection**
- Automatically groups messages into sessions
- "Late night debugging session"
- "Morning study session"
- Long chats become organized chapters

⭐ **Message Pinning**
- Star important messages
- Final answers, key prompts, decisions
- Pinned items appear on minimap

🔍 **Fast Local Search**
- Search by keywords, dates, or sessions
- No more endless scrolling
- Instant results

**Privacy-First**
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data sent to servers
- No cloud storage required
- Works completely offline
- You control everything

**Works With**
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini
- Grok
- And more AI tools

**How It Works**
1. Install the extension
2. Visit your AI chat tool
3. The minimap appears automatically
4. Navigate, pin, and search instantly

**Perfect For**
- Students managing research conversations
- Developers debugging with AI

- Anyone with long AI conversations

**Free to Use**
Core features are free. Premium features coming soon.

**Privacy by Design**
We're a UI layer, not a data collector. Your conversations never leave your browser.

Transform your AI chats from temporary conversations into structured thinking timelines.
