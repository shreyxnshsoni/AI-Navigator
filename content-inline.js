// Alternative: Inline version with sidebar component directly in content.js
// This is more reliable than loading sidebar.js separately
// Use this if the web_accessible_resources approach doesn't work

// Copy the entire content.js and add the Sidebar component definition here
// Then use React.createElement(Sidebar) directly

// This file is a reference - the main content.js should work, but if you have issues,
// you can merge sidebar.js into content.js directly
