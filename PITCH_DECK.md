# AI Navigator - Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: Title

# AI Navigator

**Transform AI conversations into structured knowledge spaces**

*Privacy-first browser extension for navigating long AI chats*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

# The Hidden Productivity Crisis

### AI chats have become daily workspaces

**But chat UX hasn't evolved**

- Students, developers, founders, researchers, creators
- Conversations now **hundreds or thousands of messages**
- Used as brainstorming sessions, debugging logs, research notebooks

### The friction:

1. **No navigation** — scrolling for minutes
2. **Lost insights** — important solutions buried
3. **No timeline** — when did I work on this?
4. **Disposable** — not reusable knowledge

**AI made thinking faster. Finding past thinking is still slow.**

---

## Slide 3: Market Opportunity

# Massive Market, Growing Problem

### Market Size

- **500M+** ChatGPT users
- **100M+** Claude users
- **Billions** of AI conversations daily
- **Average conversation length** increasing 3x year-over-year

### User Behavior Shift

- Short chats → **Long-form thinking sessions**
- Temporary conversations → **Knowledge bases**
- Single sessions → **Ongoing projects**

### The Gap

**No tools exist** to navigate long AI conversations effectively.

**First-mover advantage in a massive, growing market.**

---

## Slide 4: The Solution
