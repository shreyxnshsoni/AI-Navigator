## 🔽 Step-by-Step Manual Download

### Step 1: Download React

1. **Open this URL in your browser:**
   ```
   https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js
   ```

2. **You'll see a page full of JavaScript code** (minified React)

3. **Save the file:**
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + S` (or Right-click → Save As)
   - **Windows:** `Ctrl + S`
   - **Save as:** `react.js`
   - **Location:** `/Users/shreyanshsoni/Desktop/AI NAVIGATOR/`

### Step 2: Download ReactDOM

1. **Open this URL in your browser:**
   ```
   https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js
   ```

2. **You'll see a page full of JavaScript code** (minified ReactDOM)

3. **Save the file:**
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + S` (or Right-click → Save As)
   - **Windows:** `Ctrl + S`

## ✅ Verify Files

After downloading, check file sizes:

- **react.js** should be **~45-50 KB**
- **react-dom.js** should be **~130-140 KB**

If files are smaller (like 56 bytes), the download didn't work. Try again.

## 🚀 After Downloading

1. **Reload extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Refresh** ChatGPT/Claude page
3. **Check console** - should see: `🚀 AI Navigator Extension Active!`

---

## 🐛 Alternative: Use Browser Developer Tools

If direct download doesn't work:

1. Open browser DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Visit the React URL
4. Right-click the request → **Save response**
5. Save as `react.js`
6. Repeat for ReactDOM

**Once both files are downloaded correctly, the extension will work! 🎉**
