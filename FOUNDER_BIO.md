# Founder Bio - AI Navigator

## About the Developer

### Short Version (for Chrome Web Store - 500 characters)

**Shreyansh Soni** is a Computer Science student at Navrachana University building tools that solve real problems. AI Navigator was born from frustration: after spending hours scrolling through 1,000+ message ChatGPT conversations to find a solution from days ago, he decided to build the tool he needed.

Built entirely solo over a weekend, AI Navigator represents a "0 Rupee" approach to product development—using local processing, Shadow DOM, and browser APIs to create a privacy-first solution that costs nothing to scale.

**Why BETA?** Because great products are built with users, not in isolation. The core features are production-ready, but we're committed to making it even better with community feedback.

## Long Version (for About Page / Blog Post)

### The Story Behind AI Navigator

Hi, I'm **Shreyansh Soni**, a Computer Science student at Navrachana University in Vadodara, India.

### The Problem That Started It All

Like many developers, students, and researchers in 2024, I found myself having increasingly long conversations with AI tools. What started as quick questions became massive brainstorming sessions, debugging logs, and research notebooks—sometimes reaching 1,000+ messages in a single chat.

The breaking point came one evening when I spent 15 minutes scrolling through a ChatGPT conversation, trying to find a solution I'd implemented three days earlier. I knew it was there. I could remember the context. But finding it? That was the problem.

**AI made thinking faster. But finding past thinking was still slow.**

### The "0 Rupee" Build

As a student, I didn't have budget for cloud infrastructure, APIs, or servers. But I had something better: a clear problem and the skills to solve it.

I built AI Navigator over a single weekend using:
- **Shadow DOM** for style isolation
- **Local storage** for persistence
- **Browser APIs** for everything else
- **Zero external dependencies** (except React CDN)

The result? A privacy-first extension that costs exactly **zero rupees** to scale, respects user data completely, and solves a real problem.

### Why Privacy-First Matters

In an era where every tool seems to collect data, I wanted to build something different. AI Navigator processes everything locally in your browser. Your conversations never leave your device. There's no server to hack, no database to leak, no privacy policy to read—because we don't collect anything.

This isn't just a feature. It's the foundation.

### The BETA Philosophy

I'm calling this BETA not because it's unfinished, but because great products are built with users, not in isolation. The core features—minimap, sessions, pinning, search—are solid and production-ready. But I'm committed to making it even better based on real user feedback.

Every bug report, feature request, and piece of feedback makes AI Navigator better. That's why it's BETA: we're building this together.

### What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'm already working on:
- Session renaming and customization
- Export to markdown/PDF
- Advanced search filters
- Mobile app version

But more importantly, I'm listening. What do you need? What's missing? What would make this tool indispensable for your workflow?

### The Student-to-Founder Journey

Building AI Navigator taught me something important: you don't need a team, funding, or infrastructure to solve real problems. You need:
- A clear problem
- The skills to solve it
- The discipline to ship

Whether this becomes a portfolio piece for landing internships, a side project that generates revenue, or something I eventually sell—it's already a win. I built something that solves a real problem, and that's the foundation of any successful product.

### Join the Journey

If you're a student, developer, or creator building something—keep going. The tools are free. The problems are real. The solutions are waiting to be built.

If you're using AI Navigator, thank you. Your feedback shapes this product. Your problems become our features. Your success is our mission.
