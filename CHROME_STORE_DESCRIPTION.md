**Transform your AI conversations into a searchable knowledge base. Navigate 1,000+ message chats in seconds. 100% local. Zero data collection.**

### The Problem You're Solving

Your AI chats have become daily workspaces. What started as quick questions are now massive conversations—hundreds or thousands of messages filled with solutions, code snippets, and breakthroughs. But finding that one perfect answer from 3 days ago? You're scrolling for minutes.

**AI made thinking faster. Finding past thinking is still slow.**

### The Solution: AI Navigator

AI Navigator transforms long, messy AI chats into structured, navigable knowledge spaces. It's like giving your ChatGPT and Claude conversations a "second brain."

### ✨ Key Features

**🗺️ Conversation Minimap**
- See your entire chat at a glance
- Jump to any message instantly
- Navigate 500+ message chats in seconds
- Visual activity density and highlights

**📚 Automatic Session Detection**
- Messages automatically grouped into "chapters" based on time gaps
- "Late night debugging session" vs "Morning study session"
- Long chats become organized timelines, not chaos

**⭐ Message Pinning**
- Star important messages (solutions, code snippets, key prompts)
- Pinned items appear on minimap for instant access
- Build a permanent knowledge base from temporary chats

**🔍 Local Search**
- Real-time search through all messages
- Instant filtering as you type
- Find anything in seconds, not minutes
- Works completely offline

**⏰ Automatic Timestamps**
- Every message gets date and time
- Timeline of your thinking process
- Answer "When did I work on this?" instantly

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture

**Your conversations never leave your browser.**

- ✅ All processing happens locally
- ✅ No data sent to servers
- ✅ No cloud storage required
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ✅ You control everything

We're a UI layer, not a data collector. Privacy is our foundation, not a feature.

- **Students:** Navigate research conversations, find study notes
- **Developers:** Jump to debugging solutions, retrieve code snippets

- **Founders:** Track product decisions, retrieve brainstorming sessions
